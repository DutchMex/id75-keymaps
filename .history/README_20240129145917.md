# ID75 Keymaps

This is a home for my code (HEX and Json mostly) for the Idobao ID 75 V3 that was sold by Massdrop.

There are two folders, one for "regular" setup, where all the alpha keys are on the left hand side, and then the right hand side gets a cluster of function keys.
The other setup is for "wide" stance. This places all the left hand alphas on the left, followed by three columns of meta/function keys, then all the right hand alphas on the right.
The wide stance necessitates more use of layers, more akin to the OLKB Planck or Preonic boards and keymaps.
